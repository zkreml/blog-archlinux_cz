# lib/slug.rb -- the one shared implementation of diacritic folding and
# slugification. Used for post slugs (manage_post.rb and both migration
# scripts), tag and heading slugs, and the search index's folded text
# (build_blog.rb). It matters that all of these stay identical: post and
# tag slugs become URLs, and the index's folding must match what search.js
# does to the query on the client -- a drifted copy would quietly break
# links or search. Until this file existed, the same logic lived as four
# separate copies.

  # Letters NFKD cannot decompose, because they are letters of their own
  # rather than base + combining mark: German ß, the Latin ligatures and
  # the stroked/crossed letters of Polish, the Nordic languages, Icelandic,
  # Croatian, Maltese and Sami. Without this table they were dropped as
  # "non a-z0-9", shredding the word around them -- "Größere" became
  # "gro-ere" and "Żółć" became "zo-c". Only lowercase keys: fold below
  # downcases first, and every uppercase form ("ẞ", "Ł", "Æ"...) downcases
  # onto one of these.
  #
  # Deliberately NOT here: language-specific conventions like the German
  # ü -> ue, which would be wrong for every other language using the same
  # letter (French, Spanish, Turkish...). NFKD's generic ü -> u stays.

  # catches what NFKD can't, then lowercase and collapsed whitespace.
  # Without the NFKD step, accented characters would just get dropped as
  # "non a-z0-9" by slugify below, fragmenting the slug instead of
  # romanizing it. Mirrored client-side by fold() in search.js -- the two
  # MUST change together, or the folded search index stops matching what
  # the browser folds the query into.

  # means the address will not fit a filename -- 200 bytes is the cap the
  # engine already chose twice for post slugs, well under any
  # filesystem's limit. One answer here for the build and the checker
  # both, because the two disagreeing is a pill linking to a page the
  # build refused to make -- or a build dying in mkdir on a name check
  # had just called sound. Deliberately NOT inside slugify: heading
  # anchors share it, and capping there would renumber published anchors.
