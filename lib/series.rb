# lib/series.rb -- which posts belong together, and in what order.
#
# A series is the one relationship in this archive that a post declares
# about OTHER posts, so it is the one thing here that cannot be worked
# out from a single file. Three functions hold it: what a post says its
# series is, what that series is called as an address, and what order
# its parts go in when some of them are numbered and some are not.
#
# The ordering is the subtle one and the reason this is worth its own
# file: a numbered part is INSERTED at the position it claims among the
# unnumbered ones, rather than sorted with them, and three places in the
# engine have to agree about that -- the build, the CLI and the draft
# preview.
#
# It lives in lib/ rather than build/ for exactly that reason. While it
# sat next to the build and read the build's own post_time, the CLI could
# not load it at all: the one file whose whole purpose was to stop three
# places disagreeing was reachable from one of them. So the CLI went on
# printing the number a post CARRIES while the page printed the position
# it GETS, and with two parts claiming one slot those are different
# numbers -- said out loud, on two screens, about the same post.

  # Which series a post belongs to, the posts in it, and where this one sits

  # out of order is rare enough that the date is the right default and wrong
  # often enough that there has to be a way to say so.

  # The reading order of one series: the parts that carry no number keep
  # their chronology, and a part that names a position is put AT that
  # position among them.
  #
  # Until 1.7 this was a sort key, [has-a-number, the-number, date], which
  # read the number as "ahead of everything undated" rather than as a
  # position. The case the number exists for came out backwards: the docs'
  # own scenario -- parts 1, 2, 4, 5 written in order, then the missing
  # part 3 written last and told "3" -- put part 3 at the front and
  # relabelled the two real first parts 2 and 3. The listing, the "part N
  # of M" note and the prev/next chain all read this list, so all three
  # said it, and the CLI went on showing the number the post actually
  # carries, which is what let the two disagree out loud.
  #
  # Insertion rather than a sort key, because a position is a fact about
  # the list and not about the post: with two numbered parts in a series,
  # "3" means the third slot once "2" has taken the second, and no key
  # computed from one post alone can know that.
  # The archive's own tiebreak, kept here rather than borrowed from the
  # build: the build caches its post_time by object identity across a whole
  # run, which is worth it there and pointless for one series read once.
  # What matters is that both parse the same field the same way, so an
  # ordering asked for outside a build is the ordering a build would give.

  # What part number a post claims, read the same way wherever it is asked.

  # Base ten, said out loud. Integer("08") is OCTAL in Ruby, and eight is
  # not an octal digit -- so a part written as 08 or 09 came back nil while
  # 01 through 07 came back as themselves. With `exception: false` there
  # was no error either, just a number that quietly was not there: the
  # author numbered the parts 01..12 the way anyone numbers things, and the
  # eighth and ninth dropped out of the numbering, taking the series into
  # an order nobody asked for while every other part kept its label.
  #
  # A value that is already a number stays one (the archive stores an
  # Integer; only what a person typed is a string), and Integer() refuses a
  # base for anything but a string, so the two cases cannot be folded.

    # claiming the same slot keep their own date order instead of the
    # second shoving the first aside.
    #
    # The floor is the slot after the last number already placed, and it is
    # what keeps a bigger number from landing in front of a smaller one
    # when the numbers do not add up: parts 1, 1 and 2 have three posts for
    # two slots, and without it part 2 took the slot the second part 1 was
    # standing in. It is also what makes this identical to the old sort for
    # a series where every part is numbered -- there the floor is always
    # the end of the list, so every group is simply appended in order.
    # A number below the first position, or past the last, is one the
    # series does not have; the clamp gives it the nearest one it does.
