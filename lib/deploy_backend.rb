# lib/deploy_backend.rb -- picks where ./scripts/deploy-web.sh ships the
# build. Selected by DEPLOY_BACKEND in env.sh (surfer | local | rsync |
# git | rclone | sftp); unset falls back to Surfer, which was the only
# target before backends existed -- an old env.sh with just the SURFER_*
# values keeps working untouched.
#
# The contract every backend implements:
#   label            human name for the deploy log
#   configured?      are its env.sh settings present
#   target           destination string for the log header
#   manifest_suffix  distinguishes .deploy_manifest*.json per target, so
#                    switching backends can't reuse another target's state
# plus ONE of:
#   session { |s| }  per-file: yields a handle whose upload/delete return
#                    :ok/:failed/:missing/:skipped, like lib/surfer.rb
#   sync(...)        batch: one run covers the whole build -- either the
#                    target diffs itself (rsync, rclone, git) or it
#                    executes the manifest's precomputed files:/orphans:
#                    lists verbatim (sftp)
# and optionally:
#   always_prunes?   true for snapshot backends (git) whose every deploy
#                    mirrors the build exactly, deleting orphans with or
#                    without --prune -- deploy_web.rb keeps its manifest
#                    and messages honest about that
#
# deploy_web.rb's manifest diff and the shrink/growth safeguards run
# BEFORE either path -- they're target-independent on purpose, so even a
# batch backend with its own diffing (rsync --delete would happily mirror
# a broken build) stays behind the same guards.
