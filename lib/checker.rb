# What `./blog.sh check` finds. Doctor's counterpart, and deliberately a
# separate thing: doctor answers "is this installation sound", reads a
# handful of config values and takes a second, while this walks every post
# and every media file in the archive. Rolled into one command, the fast
# half would stop being run.
#
# It reads the CONTENT rather than the built site. A finding has to name a
# post and a slug -- something to go and fix -- rather than a file under
# public.nosync, and it must work before a build has ever run. Judging
# links still needs to know what addresses the build produces, so those are
# derived here from the same rules build_blog.rb uses.
#
# It only ever reports. Nothing here deletes an orphaned media directory or
# rewrites a post: the whole value of the tool is that its output can be
# trusted, and a checker that also acts is one that has to be trusted twice.
