# lib/exporter.rb -- the archive as a tree of markdown files: what
# `./blog.sh export` writes, and the mirror of lib/import/. The engine
# imports from twenty-two places, so it owes the same courtesy in the
# other direction -- a site that cannot be taken elsewhere is a site
# nobody should be asked to move in.
#
# The tree is Jekyll's, because it is the layout the most other engines
# read: `_posts/<date>-<slug>.md`, `_drafts/<slug>.md`, pages at the
# root, media under `assets/`. Hugo, Eleventy and Astro read it with a
# config line; blog.sh's own Import::Jekyll reads it with nothing at all,
# which is what makes the round-trip test possible.
#
# It only ever reads. Nothing here touches content.nosync, media.nosync
# or the built site: an export that could damage the archive it is
# leaving with would be the one tool nobody could afford to run.

  # Block by block rather than in one call, so a block markdown cannot
  # write down can be spotted and given an HTML form instead of
  # disappearing. MarkdownWriter drops what it has no syntax for -- the
  # link card, an imported embed -- which is right for `edit` (the CLI
  # has a loss guard behind it) and wrong here: an export is the last
  # copy somebody keeps.
  #
  # Rendering one block at a time is equivalent to rendering them
  # together: the writer carries no state between blocks, it maps and
  # joins with a blank line, which is what happens here too.
  # Video and audio skip the markdown path even though the writer HAS
  # syntax for them, because that syntax is this engine's own: `!![cap](url)`
  # is, to CommonMark -- which is what Jekyll, Hugo and Eleventy read -- a
  # literal "!" followed by an IMAGE. Exported that way, a YouTube video
  # renders on the destination site as an exclamation mark and a broken
  # image, and re-importing the tree fetched YouTube's HTML page and filed
  # it in the archive as `02.jpg`. Caught against a real 118-post archive;
  # no fixture would have shown it, because both ends were ours.
  #
  # An attachment is here for the same reason, one step further out. Its
  # markdown form is `[label](file.pdf)` with a BARE filename -- that is
  # what tells the parser an attachment from an ordinary link -- and the
  # export has to write the path it really has, `/assets/<year>/<slug>/`.
  # Read back, that is no longer a filename, so the block came home as a
  # paragraph with a link in it: the label, the size and the block type
  # gone, and the file itself left behind in the tree because nothing
  # claimed it. The HTML form loses none of that, and a download link is
