# Six paths write a post into a year: publish (including the scheduler's
# cron), edit, scheduling a date, moving the queue, restoring from the
# trash and re-importing. Each of them asked `File.exist?` about the exact
# file it was about to write, which answers a narrower question than the
# one that matters. Two posts collide when they share a year and a slug --
# whatever FOLDER they sit in -- and two pages collide on their slug alone,
# because a page is served at the root with no year in its address.
#
# The build refuses to run on either, so a path that failed to see the
# collision did not merely overwrite something: it left an archive that
# will not build, and on the scheduler's path there is nobody at the
# keyboard to read the error. Deciding this in six places is how five of
# them stayed a step behind the sixth.

  # The file standing in the way of this write, or nil. Two questions, and
  # both of them have to be asked here, because five callers asked only one
  # of them each and each one asked the other's.
  #
  #   `path`  -- the FILE about to be written. A different post already
  #              there is overwritten with no trash, no version and no
  #              warning, and that is not hypothetical: a post whose file
  #              sits in one year's folder while its date puts its address
  #              in another (which the engine documents as ordinary) has a
  #              free address and an occupied path at the same time.
  #   the address -- which no path check can see, because a page is served
  #              at the root and a post follows its date, not its folder.
  #
  # Replacing the old File.exist? with the address check, rather than
  # adding to it, is how publish, edit, scheduling, restore and re-import
  # came to silently eat a live published post.
  #
  # `except` is the post's own file, which is never in its own way. It
  # takes a list as well as a single path: a queue swap moves two posts
  # past each other, and each of them stands exactly where the other is
  # going. Asked one at a time, both writes are refused and a legitimate
  # swap of two same-named posts in two years could not be done at all --
  # while the pair, asked together, is a question about the state AFTER
  # the move, which is the state that matters. The caller still has to
  # check that the two are not moving onto the same address.
