# lib/atomic_write.rb -- replace a file's contents, or leave the file
# exactly as it was.
#
# File.write opens with "w": it truncates the target FIRST and only then
# finds out it can't write (a full volume, a vanished mount, a killed
# container). What was a perfectly good post then sits on disk as 0 bytes
# -- the previous version destroyed, the new one never written, and after
# an `edit` the author's text has already left the editor's temp file.
# Nothing restores that: content.nosync/ isn't in git and nothing moved
# the post to trash/.
#
# Writing a sibling temp file and renaming it over the target makes the
# replacement all-or-nothing. The temp file has to live in the SAME
# directory as its target -- rename(2) is only atomic within one
# filesystem, so a temp in /tmp would silently degrade to a copy.

  # permissions: the mode the finished file must end up with. A rename
  # REPLACES the target, mode and all, so without saying so a file that
  # was 0644 comes back as whatever the umask allowed the temp -- and
  # under a strict umask (0077) that is a page the web server can no
  # longer read. Left unsaid, the target's own mode is kept, and a file
  # that did not exist yet gets the umask's answer, exactly as a plain
  # File.write would have given it.
  # durable: whether to wait for the disk before calling the write done.
  #
  # Two different promises live in this method and they are worth telling
  # apart. ATOMICITY -- a sibling temp renamed into place -- costs almost
  # nothing and protects against the common disaster: a process killed
  # mid-write, a full volume, a container stopped. DURABILITY, the two
  # fsyncs, protects against a much rarer one: the machine losing power
  # between the write and the disk actually taking it. It is not free.
  # Measured over a thousand-post archive, the fsyncs made a cold build
  # 25% slower -- every page, feed and index waiting twice for a disk.
  #
  # So the archive pays and the output does not. A post is the only copy
  # of something somebody wrote; if the power goes during a save, nothing
  # brings it back. public.nosync is derived: if the power goes during a
  # build, the next build writes it again, which is a thing that happens
  # anyway. Buying insurance against losing what can be regenerated in two
  # seconds is how a build ends up slower for no one's benefit.
  #
  # Atomicity stays on both paths, because a half-written page is served
  # to readers and a rename is what makes that impossible.
