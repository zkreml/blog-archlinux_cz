  # Imports a tree of markdown posts with front matter -- a Jekyll site
  # (_posts/ and _drafts/), a Hugo content/ directory, or any folder of
  # .md files a converter produced (Meddler's Medium output,
  # Substack2Markdown's, ...). The body IS blog.sh's native language, so
  # it goes through the same MarkdownParser that authoring uses -- no
  # HTML round-trip -- and .html bodies take the HtmlBlocks path instead.
  #
  # Images come from the tree where the tree has them -- a relative or
  # root-relative path is read off disk, and that half really does work
  # for a site that died years ago. An absolute URL goes to the network
  # like anywhere else, and a tree exported from a hosted platform is
  # mostly those: a real Hugo `content/` gave this 72 images to resolve
  # and 70 were https:// links back to the WordPress it had been migrated
  # from, of which 66 answered 404. The archive is only as complete as the
  # old host is still willing to be, and the summary is where that is said.

      # the second blog's posts landed ON the first blog's and overwrote
