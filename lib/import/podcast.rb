module Import
  # Imports a podcast from its RSS feed -- Libsyn, Buzzsprout, Anchor,
  # anything that publishes episodes as items with an enclosure.
  # Feed already knows how to read the XML, dates, ids and shownote HTML;
  # what a podcast adds is the media itself: each episode's file downloads
  # and leads the post as a native audio (or video) block, with the
  # episode artwork above it. Local files on purpose -- the archive has to
  # outlive the hosting account, which is usually why anyone migrates a
  # podcast.
  #
  # The enclosure is the episode's defining part: an item without one is
  # not an episode (a blog post syndicated into the same feed) and is
  # skipped with its own count.

    # switches the question off -- it is capability-detected.
