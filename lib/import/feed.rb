    #
    # And a custom post type is named after itself. A blog with a portfolio
    # or a recipe section keeps those in their own type, with a title, a
    # body and categories like any post -- TryGhost's mg-wp-xml fixtures

    # four figures a line reading "1234 skipped (not a post)" hides forty
    # articles inside itself. Named by type, the summary says "40 skipped
    # (portfolio)" and the author can see what stayed behind.
