  # Rescues a blog from the Wayback Machine -- for the platform that no

  # archived the blog's FEED too, over and over across the years, and
  # each capture carries the posts of its day. Read every distinct
  # capture oldest-first and the whole history reassembles itself --
  # re-import matching merges the overlaps, newer captures win.

  # Images ride the same time machine: every image URL is rerouted
  # through web.archive.org, which redirects to its nearest capture of

    # b2evolution -- self-hosted blog software, the workhorse of the
    # 2003-2010 blogosphere's first wave. No host shape to recognize
    # (every installation lived on its own domain), so this pack is
    # chosen by markup or by name, never by address.
    #
    # Verified against a real 2008 skin, not documentation: the body sits
    # in <div class="bText">, rendered by the stock _item_content.inc.php
    # template that skins practically never replaced -- which is what
    # makes this pack general. The title is <h3 class="bTitle"> (an <h2>
    # fallback for skins that used the request title); tags are links in
    # <div class="posttags"> behind a localized label ("Tags:",
    # "Značky:"); ads and search boxes sit OUTSIDE bText, so taking only
    # the balanced div excludes them by construction.
    #
    # The date is the skin's choice. The numeric form b2evolution shipped
    # is y/m/d with a TWO-DIGIT year ("08/12/07" is 2008-12-07 -- not
    # guessable from a rendered page, taken from the template source),
    # tried alongside the four-digit form; anything else falls back to
    # the capture timestamp, which map_page already counts out loud.
