# lib/post_stats.rb -- favourite/boost/comment counts for announced
# posts, precomputed server-side into public/stats.json, and (when
# comment moderation is on) the approved comments themselves into
# public/comments.json. Handles both networks: a post carries either
# mastodon_url or bluesky_uri (never both -- see
# SiteConfig.comment_network), and that stored value is also the key the
# client looks up in either file.
#
# Originally fetched by the visitor's browser: a request to the network's
# API for every post in a listing. Harmless while only three posts were
# announced, but it grows with every new article -- and it's exactly the
# pattern already removed from the sidebar widgets (rate limits, leaking
# visitors' IPs to a third party, waiting on a foreign server's response).
#
# Fetched exclusively by cron via scripts/refresh_sidebar.rb, not the
# normal build: that's up to two requests per announced post, which would
# gradually choke the build.
#
# Engagement barely changes on old posts -- so `fetch_all(recent_only:
# true)` only live-refreshes posts younger than RECENT_WINDOW_DAYS,
# leaving older ones to an infrequent full refresh (refresh_sidebar.rb
# runs one roughly weekly). Without this, every cron run would make
# requests per *every* published post ever -- harmless today, hundreds
# of requests per run a few years from now.
#
# --- Moderation --------------------------------------------------------
#
# With `comments.approval: fav` the same requests do one more job: they
# ask the network which replies the author favourited, and only those are
# published. The check costs nothing extra on the wire -- both networks
# answer "did the authenticated account like this?" as a field on the
# very response this file already asks for, provided the request carries
# credentials the site already has:
#
#   Mastodon   /context descendants carry `favourited` -- but only for an
#              authenticated request, which is why the token is threaded
#              through (scope read:statuses, alongside write:statuses the
#              announcement already needs).
#   Bluesky    getPostThread carries post.viewer.like -- but only when
#              called against the PDS with a session, not against the
#              public AppView, which knows no viewer.
#
# Two rules beyond "was it favourited", both there to keep the result
# readable rather than merely filtered:
#
#   * the author's own replies are approved automatically. Nobody stars
#     their own posts, and without this the author's half of every
#     exchange would vanish and the page would look broken.
#   * a reply shows only if every reply between it and the announcement
#     shows too. Otherwise an approved answer to a rejected comment sits
#     there answering nothing.
#
# The approval step is its own ceiling on how big comments.json can get:
# every entry in it was hand-starred by one person.

  # Answers one question for `doctor --online`: can this site's
  # credentials see its own approvals at all? Returns :ok when the
  # network answered with viewer state, :blind when it answered without
  # it, and raises when it didn't answer.
  #
  # :blind is the failure worth naming. A token missing read:statuses
  # doesn't refuse anything -- it gets a perfectly good response with
  # `favourited` left out of it, which reads as "the author has approved
  # nothing" and empties every thread on the site. The probe asks about
  # the announcement rather than a reply so it works on a post nobody has
  # answered yet.
  # :blind means one thing only: the network answered ABOUT THIS POST and
  # left the viewer state out of the answer. It used to be returned for two
  # situations the credentials have nothing to do with -- an address
  # parse_toot_url could not read, and an announcement that is deleted or
  # momentarily unreachable, where there is no post to carry a viewer at
  # all. doctor renders :blind as "your credentials cannot see your
  # favourites" with a fix that says reissue the token, so a post the author
  # deleted last month came back as a bug report about env.sh. Both now
  # raise, which doctor already handles: approval_probe_failed quotes the
  # message instead of naming a culprit.

      # one that can be a host the site does not run on -- sending the
      # bearer there hands a stranger a credential that can post as the
