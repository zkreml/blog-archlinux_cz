# lib/markdown_writer.rb -- content blocks -> markdown text, the mirror of
# lib/markdown_parser.rb. Used by `blog.sh edit` to reopen a stored post as
# editable markdown; parse_body then turns the edited text back into
# blocks. Extracted from manage_post.rb, same as the parser before it, so
# the two directions of the round-trip sit next to each other in lib/.
#
# The output is always valid markdown for the parser to re-read, but not
# necessarily byte-identical to whatever the author originally typed --
# equivalent formatting (e.g. ties between overlapping spans) may come out
# normalized.

  # Characters that mean something and can therefore be escaped with a
  # backslash. Deliberately only these: a backslash before anything else is
  # left as-is -- otherwise emoticons like `d8-\` in older imported posts
  # would get mangled. The block sigils (# > - + . _ |) are in the class so
  # the parser unescapes them, but they are only ever ESCAPED at the spots
  # where they would mean something: the start of a line (see
  # escape_block_starts) and inside table cells -- escaping every hashtag
  # in a tweet archive would bury the text in backslashes.
  # ")" is here for the backslash rule only: escape_block_starts writes
  # "1\\)" so a line-leading "1) " cannot become a list, and the parser
  # therefore unescapes \\) -- which meant an author's own "\\)" lost its
  # backslash on the next save. Listed here, escape_markdown doubles that
  # backslash on the way out and the two directions agree again. ")" itself
  # is never escaped; only a backslash before it is.

  # Higher number = renders further out when two spans cover the exact same
  # range (e.g. "**[text](url)**", where the bold and the link entries end up
  # with identical start/end).
  #
  # Every value is DISTINCT, and that is the point: the containment test in
  # render_markdown_range asks whether some other span dominates this one,
  # with a strict >. Two types sharing a number meant neither dominated, so
  # both were emitted as top-level and the shared text was written TWICE --
  # "`code`" inside a link came back as "config.rbconfig.rb", doubling again
  # with every edit. `link`/`code` and `italic`/`strikethrough` were the two
  # colliding pairs, and both shapes come straight out of the HTML importers.
  #
  # The order itself is not arbitrary either: code is innermost because a
  # link wrapping code ("[`config.rb`](url)") round-trips with both spans
  # intact, while code wrapping a link ("`[config.rb](url)`") is markdown for
  # a literal string and loses the link entirely.
