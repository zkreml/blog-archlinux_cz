# lib/run_lock.rb -- one writer of public.nosync at a time.
#
# Everything that builds or deploys writes into the same public.nosync and
# reads the same deploy manifest, and two of them run from cron: the
# scheduled publish every 15 minutes, the sidebar refresh every 30. On a
# large archive a build plus a full deploy takes longer than a tick, so
# overlapping runs are an ordinary Tuesday rather than an exotic race --
# and what they do to each other is not subtle. A deploy walks a tree the
# other run is rewriting (ENOENT on a file that was there a moment ago), or
# prunes as an orphan a page the other run has just published, or writes a
# manifest describing a build that no longer exists.
#
# So: an advisory whole-file lock, taken without waiting. A run that finds
# the lock held does NOT queue up behind it -- cron will come back in
# fifteen minutes, and a queue of blocked publishes would all wake up at
# once and do the same work again. It says so and leaves.
#
# The lock is per installation (the file lives in the repo root), and it
# is inherited: `rebuild_and_deploy` shells out to build_blog.rb and
# deploy_web.rb as separate processes, and those must run inside the lock
# their parent already holds rather than deadlock against it.

  # stops promising "in a minute" and says since when it has held the
  # lock. flock has no timeout, so a hung publish holds every queue
  # write hostage while the message keeps sounding routine. Thirty
  # minutes is two cron intervals and far above a full build-plus-deploy
  # on a large archive -- a false alarm takes deliberate effort. A DEAD
  # holder needs none of this: the kernel released its flock the moment
  # it ended, whatever the lock file still says.

  # gives it its meaning: it is this file's contract with the four scripts
  # that take the lock and with everyone who shells out to them, and a
  # caller that had to reach into the publishing library for it either
  # dragged that library along or compared against a literal 3.

  # `busy_exit:` is the difference between a cron tick and a person. A

  # started at a terminal exits non-zero, because its caller (./blog.sh,
  # publishing) must not be told a deploy happened when it did not.
  # `quiet_when_busy:` is what makes the paragraph above true. Cron mails
  # on OUTPUT, not on the exit code, and the busy message went to stderr
  # unconditionally -- so the documented crontab (a publish every 15
  # minutes, a sidebar refresh every 30) mailed on every collision at :00
  # and :30, which is most of them: roughly forty-eight notes a day saying
  # nothing is wrong. A holder that looks STUCK is still said out loud,
