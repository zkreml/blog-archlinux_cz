# lib/publishing.rb -- the mechanics of making a draft public, shared by
# the interactive CLI (scripts/manage_post.rb) and the scheduled-publish
# cron (scripts/publish_scheduled.rb). The split is decisions vs
# execution: the CLI owns every prompt (which date to use, whether to toot
# outside the recency window), the cron owns no prompt at all -- a schedule
# IS the decision -- and both execute through here, so the two paths can't
# drift apart.
#
# What the cron does have to decide alone is whether to ANNOUNCE, which is
# the one thing here that cannot be undone. The rules it decides by live in
# this file rather than in either caller (TOOT_RECENCY_WINDOW and the two
# predicates under it): the window was a constant inside the CLI once, and
# the caller that could not ask anybody was the caller that did not have it.
