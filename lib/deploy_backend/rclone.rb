  # rclone covers the long tail of targets in one integration: S3, R2, B2,
  # WebDAV, Azure, GCS, SFTP and dozens more. RCLONE_TARGET is a
  # remote:path the user has set up with `rclone config` -- credentials
  # live in rclone's own config, never in env.sh. RCLONE_ARGS optionally
  # appends extra flags (e.g. provider-specific ACLs).
  #
  # `rclone copy` (never deletes) on a normal deploy, `rclone sync`
  # (mirrors deletions) under --prune -- both delta-diff by size+modtime
  # against the target, so unchanged files aren't retransferred. Shells
  # out to the system rclone binary, same no-gems principle as rsync.
