module DeployBackend
  # Pushes the build as a single-commit snapshot to a git branch --
  # GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg Pages then serve it, with HTTPS and hosting for
  # free. GIT_PAGES_REMOTE is any git remote URL (typically SSH);
  # GIT_PAGES_BRANCH defaults to gh-pages; GIT_PAGES_CNAME optionally
  # writes a CNAME file for a custom domain (GitHub stores custom-domain
  # config as a CNAME file *in the branch*, so a snapshot push would
  # silently wipe one configured through the UI -- setting it here
  # re-writes it on every deploy instead).
  #
  # Every deploy builds a fresh throwaway repo and force-pushes one
  # commit: no persistent clone to keep in sync, no merge conflicts, and
  # the served branch always equals the build exactly. That also means
  # orphans disappear on every push, --prune or not (always_prunes?).
  # The branch keeps no site history on purpose -- the source repo
  # already has it. A .nojekyll file is added so GitHub Pages serves the
  # files verbatim instead of running them through Jekyll.
