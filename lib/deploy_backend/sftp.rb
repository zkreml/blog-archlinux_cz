  # Plain SFTP for hosts that offer neither rsync nor git -- openssh's
  # `sftp -b` batch mode: one connection executes the whole generated
  # batch file (mkdirs, puts, deletes), instead of a connection per file.
  # SFTP_TARGET is user@host; SFTP_REMOTE_DIR optionally changes into a
  # remote directory first (create nested paths beforehand -- only one
  # level is auto-created); SFTP_ARGS appends extra flags (e.g. "-P 2022").
  #
  # Unlike rsync/git/rclone this target can't diff itself -- but that's
  # exactly what deploy_web.rb's manifest is for: `files:` and `orphans:`
  # arrive precomputed, and the batch mirrors them one to one. Commands
  # prefixed with "-" may fail without aborting the batch (an existing
  # directory on -mkdir, a non-empty one on -rmdir); a failed `put` or
  # `cd` aborts, which is what fails the deploy.

    # file people reformat, and adding -vv to watch a failing deploy is not
    # moving to another host. Compared as a string, every such edit read as
    # a new target -- and a new target throws the manifest away, which is
    # the only record of what stands on the far end. The re-upload is the
    # cheap half of that: the orphans the manifest knew about become
    # unreachable, so a post deleted at home goes on being served forever
    # and no switch exists that would find it again.

    # A switch nobody here recognises stays IN. That costs a needless
