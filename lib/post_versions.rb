# The undo the engine did not have. Deleting a post has always been
# reversible -- it goes to trash/ and `restore` brings it back -- but
# EDITING one was not, and editing is the thing that happens every day.
# A paragraph deleted and saved, a round-trip through markdown that could
# not express something, a paste into the wrong place: all of them were
# final.
#
# So the previous state is put aside before a post is overwritten. Not
# configurable, on purpose: a safety net with a switch is off exactly when
# it is needed, because nobody turns it on before the mistake. The engine
# treats its other guards the same way -- trash/, the slug-collision abort
# and the deploy guards are not optional either; only the destructive
# direction (--prune) is.
#
# Deliberately NOT git for content: no branches, no diffing two arbitrary
# points, no history to browse. And not a backup -- it lives beside the
# content, so it dies with it. The backup list in docs/operations.md still
# applies.
