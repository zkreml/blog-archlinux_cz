# lib/site_header.rb -- the "which site am I connected to" banner both
# wizards (./blog.sh and ./import.sh) print at startup and after every
# screen clear. Shared rather than duplicated: someone running several
# blog.sh installs should see the same identity block whichever tool
# they're in, and it should never drift between the two.
#
# An accent bar rather than a boxed panel so it never needs a bordered
# panel's width-matching discipline (see the design discussion this came
# out of): each line stands alone, so a long site name or claim just makes
# that one line longer instead of risking mismatched corners on a narrow
# terminal. Site fields are all optional -- on a barely-started install
# they can be blank, and absent ones are skipped rather than rendered as
# an empty line.

  # Read here rather than through SiteConfig, and quietly. SiteConfig
  # ABORTS on a config that will not parse -- and it prints before it
  # raises, so the rescue at the bottom of this method caught the exit but
  # not the message. `./blog.sh help` on a broken install therefore opened
  # with a YAML error nobody had asked it for. This banner is a courtesy
  # on top of whatever command is running; it has no business speaking for
  # the config. `doctor` still says it, at length, because that is the one
  # command whose whole job is to.
  #
  # Deliberately not memoised. The wizards render this banner repeatedly
  # in one process -- after every screen clear -- and a config written
  # mid-session should show through on the next render rather than at the
  # next launch. It is one small file, read a handful of times per run.
