# lib/markdown_parser.rb -- markdown text -> content blocks (the JSON schema
# shared with the Tumblr/Twitter importers and build_blog.rb).
#
# Extracted from scripts/manage_post.rb, where this logic lived as ~270
# lines of top-level functions and couldn't be reused cleanly from anywhere
# else -- build_blog.rb can now render other pages from the same parser too
# (see the markdown cheat sheet page). The opposite direction (blocks ->
# markdown, for `blog.sh edit`) stays in manage_post.rb -- that's purely an
# authoring concern the build never needs.
#
# `resolve_image`/`parse_prose_block`/`parse_body` take `incoming_dir:` as a
# parameter instead of reaching for a global constant -- manage_post.rb
# passes its own INCOMING_DIR (SFTP staging for writing from a phone),
# build_blog.rb leaves it `nil` (pages outside content/posts/ have no local
# images today; if they ever did, the bare-filename shorthand just wouldn't
# be resolvable for them -- only a full path would work).

  # --- inline formatting ---------------------------------------------------

  # Alternation order matters: escape must come first, so `\*` never opens
  # italics. A link also accepts an optional quoted title -- without this
  # the title used to get shoved into the address and the link ended up dead.
  # The escape class and the writer's ESCAPABLE change together: every
  # character the writer may put a backslash before must lose it here, or
  # the backslash becomes visible text on the next edit. ")" is in the
  # class for exactly that reason and is NOT in ESCAPABLE: the writer only
  # ever escapes it at the start of a line, where "1) first" would
  # otherwise round-trip into an ordered list -- but the backslash it
  # wrote had no way back out, so imported "1) ... 2) ..." enumerations
  # published a visible "1\)" the moment anything else in the post was
  # edited. The block sigils
  # (# > - + . _ |) joined for the writer's line-start escaping -- a
  # paragraph beginning ">50 %" must not round-trip into a quote.
  #
  # The link target allows one level of balanced parentheses
  # ("/Page(ID-123).aspx"), matching what CommonMark does; the writer
  # percent-encodes the pathological rest.
  #
  # The label may be EMPTY -- "[](url)" is a real shape, not a typo.
  # Converters out of WordPress write the anchor they once put in a
  # heading that way, and one 74-post Hugo tree had 161 of them across
  # 14 posts. Required to have a character, the whole thing missed and
  # the reader was shown the brackets and the address in the heading;
  # what parse_inline does with the match instead is written there.
  # Six extra alternatives carry the star collisions the writer
  # legitimately produces when bold and italic meet. A run of stars is
  # not one delimiter: three of them between two letters can close one
  # span and open another, which is what CommonMark's delimiter runs say
  # and what an author means. The shapes are "***both***",
  # "***head*rest**" (italic on the head of a bold span),
  # "***head**rest*" (bold on the head of an italic one),
  # "**pre*tail***" (italic on its tail), "**bold***italic*" --
  # adjacency, the middle run splitting two-plus-one -- and its mirror
  # "*italic***bold**", splitting one-plus-two.
  # The collision shapes use a tempered dot -- (?:(?!\*\*).) -- so their
  # halves can never reach ACROSS an ordinary bold boundary to a "***"
  # further down the paragraph; without it, "**A** ... ***x***" read as
  # one giant span from A to x. The head shapes' REST halves and btail
  # are tighter still: a rest may hold complete nested runs ("**x**"
  # inside an italic's rest, "*x*" inside a bold's) but never a lone
  # star, and btail no stars at all -- a lone star there is always a
  # closer being stolen from a span further right, which surfaced as
  # stray asterisks in the text. Plain italic refuses a closer that
  # touches other stars for the same reason: the star before "**de**"
  # inside "*ab~~c**de**f~~ghij*" is bold's opener, not italic's closer.
  #
  # Alternative order is load-bearing, in both directions. Plain bold --
  # whose closer is exactly two stars, the (?!\*) guard -- comes BEFORE
  # the tail-collision shapes, or "**F** dál ... ***v***" reads as one
  # span from F to v. The adjacency shapes come AFTER them, immediately
  # before plain italic: placed any earlier they take matches that
  # belong to the tail collisions, and partially overlapping spans --
  # what every NPF import produces -- come back with stray asterisks in
  # the text. They may only have what nothing else can read.
  # tests/test_markdown_roundtrip.rb walks all 1085 assignments of up to
  # three spans -- permutations and repeated types included; that matrix
  # is what these positions were settled against, and what will notice
