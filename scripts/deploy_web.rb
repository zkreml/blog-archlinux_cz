# scripts/deploy_web.rb -- uploads public.nosync/ (the build output) to
# the configured deploy backend: Cloudron Surfer (the default), a local
# directory, or rsync -- see lib/deploy_backend.rb and DEPLOY_BACKEND in
# env.sh. Run via ./scripts/deploy-web.sh, which sources env.sh first.
#
# Smart sync: a manifest (.deploy_manifest.json at the project root, outside
# public.nosync/ so the build doesn't delete it) holds the SHA256 hash, size
# and mtime of every uploaded file -- only files that are new or have a
# different hash get uploaded. Since the build doesn't rewrite files whose
# content hasn't changed (`emit` compares before writing), a match on size
# and mtime against the stored values reliably means unchanged content --
# SHA256 (reading the whole file) is then only computed for the few files
# that are new or have a different size/mtime, not for every file in
# public.nosync/ on every deploy.
#
# Deletion: the build can also remove files (a deleted post, renumbered
# pages), but those left live URLs behind on Surfer. --prune deletes
# whatever is in the manifest but no longer in public.nosync/. Deliberately
# opt-in, not part of a normal deploy -- it's the only destructive operation
# in this whole script.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-web.sh                     # uploads only new/changed files
#   ./scripts/deploy-web.sh --force             # ignores the manifest, uploads everything
#   ./scripts/deploy-web.sh --only=A[,B,...]    # uploads only the listed files
#   ./scripts/deploy-web.sh --prune             # also deletes orphaned files on Surfer
#   ./scripts/deploy-web.sh --dry-run           # only prints what it would do (doesn't need Surfer)

# Every other entry point inherits this from lib/site_config.rb; this one
# does not load it. Without it a cron run -- where LANG is unset -- reads
# the manifest and the paths inside it as US-ASCII, so a single accented
# filename raises out of JSON.parse or out of a path comparison and BOTH
# crons die on every tick, with the deploy never completing again.

# of the pages (a typo in a path, an empty content dir, a crashed run),
# --prune would happily delete the rest of the live site and the deploy
# would upload wreckage. The mirror case matters too: a sharp INCREASE is
# just as likely to be duplicate posts or an accidentally copied tree.
#
# The two directions do NOT get the same reference, and that asymmetry is
# the whole fix:
#
# * A DROP measures against the largest reference available -- the accepted
#   build, or the manifest if it happens to be bigger. Every manifest entry
#   is a file that really did upload, so a partial manifest can only ever
#   UNDERSTATE the site. As a floor it can therefore hide a drop, never
#   invent one, which makes it safe to take the maximum and keeps the guard
#   armed on an install that has no baseline yet.
# * GROWTH measures against the accepted build ONLY. The manifest
#   legitimately lags the build (a failed upload, a fresh target, a
#   switched backend), and reading that lag as growth IS the defect this
#   replaces.
