# Scriptable import of a markdown tree with front matter -- a Jekyll
# site, a Hugo content directory, or any folder of .md files a converter
# produced (Meddler for Medium, Substack2Markdown, ...). The mapping
# lives in lib/import/jekyll.rb and is shared with ./import.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby scripts/migrate_jekyll.rb <path-to-site-tree>
#   PERMALINK='/:year/:month/:day/:title/' ruby scripts/migrate_jekyll.rb <dir>
#   LIMIT=20 ruby scripts/migrate_jekyll.rb <dir>            # trial run
#   KEEP_PERMALINKS=1 PERMALINK=... ruby scripts/migrate_jekyll.rb <dir>
#
# Relative and root-relative image paths come from the tree itself and
# need no network, so that half works for a site that died years ago. An
# absolute URL is downloaded -- and a tree exported from a hosted platform
# is mostly those, so run this while the old host still answers and read
# the summary's count before rebuilding.
# PERMALINK is the old site's pattern (:year :month :day
# :title), needed because a Jekyll tree does not carry its own URL shape;
# a post's explicit front matter permalink always wins over it.
