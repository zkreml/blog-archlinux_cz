#   WAYBACK_FROM=2013-01 WAYBACK_TO=2013-06 ...              # capture window
#     (the Wayback calendar's year/month picker as parameters: only
#      captures inside the window are read. Filters CAPTURES, not posts --
#      a late window is how you reach a blog's end without replaying its
#      whole history, but posts the feed no longer carried by then are
#      not in the run.)

#
# For a blog whose platform no longer exists: the Wayback Machine
# archived its FEED again and again over the years, and reading every
# distinct capture oldest-first reassembles the history -- overlaps
# merge through the usual re-import matching. Point it at the blog's
# old URL (the common feed paths are tried) or straight at the feed.
#
# A blog the Archive only ever saw as pages falls through to PAGE MODE:
# every archived post page, newest capture of each. Which paths are
# posts is decided by a platform pack (blog.cz ships built in), or by
# POST_PATTERN -- with neither, the run refuses and shows sample paths
# to build a pattern from. Images are recovered from the Archive too;
# what it never saw is lost and counted. The Archive rate-limits: one
# request per second by default, so a long history takes a while and
# narrates its progress.
