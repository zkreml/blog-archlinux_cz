# Changelog

Every released version, newest first, so a clone can answer "what changed?"
without going to GitHub. Each entry says what was wrong and what it meant in
practice -- a one-line "fixed a bug" is no use to someone deciding whether an
upgrade is urgent for them.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`: a patch release fixes defects and never
changes configuration, content or the shape of a post file; a minor release
adds features and stays compatible with existing sites. `./blog.sh version`
prints what an installation is running.


## 1.8 -- 2026-09-14

The release about what happens when something goes wrong. A page is written whole or not at all, a
delivery that arrives twice is one post, a name that was never meant to be a path is refused rather
than repaired into an address nobody chose -- and `check` asks what the build asks, so an archive it
calls sound is one the build can run on. Before the tag, five narrow review passes went through the
write paths, the build's output, import and export, `check` and the series; everything they found
is fixed here. Nothing to configure and nothing to migrate. Two things look different: a series of
twenty parts or more opens at part one, and a tree exported from blog.sh asks before it goes into an
archive that already has posts.

### Added

- **`props` says where a numbered part will actually stand.** Only when that differs from its number.
- **A release checklist.** `docs/releasing.md`, nine steps, the build's speed among them.
- **Importing a site's own export says so first, and asks.** Recognised by its posts, so exports made by any version count.
- **`check` finds a post file the build never reads.** One lying directly in `posts/`, or a folder too deep.

### Changed

- **Every page, feed and index is written to a temp file and renamed.** A reader never meets half of one.
- **A cold build costs about a fifth more.** Cached rebuilds are unchanged, so publishing costs the same.
- **A long series opens at part one.** `/series/<slug>/` holds the first parts, `/page/2/` on the ones after -- other parts than in 1.7.
- **`export --force` refreshes only what an export of this site wrote.** A cloned site's `_config.yml` and anyone else's files are left alone and listed.
- **An export closes each HTML block with `<!-- /blogsh:block -->`.** Trees exported before 1.8 are still read.
- **An export says which blog it came from.** `_config.yml`, unless the target already has one of its own.
- **An export that could not write a post leaves with 1.** The rest of the archive still comes out, and the post is named.
- **An export says how many media files no block names.** A re-import brings home only what the posts refer to.
- **A cancelled import leaves with 1.** Zero no longer means "nobody answered".
- **`check` has more to say.** An unusable `former_slugs` entry, a post that looks like a copy, an old address a live post has taken, two addresses that are one folder on macOS.
- **A question `check` cannot ask is one finding, not the end of the run.** It names the question and the error.
- **`--repair` shows what an entity fix will change.** And says when text escaped twice still has a layer left.
- **A page the build cannot write is a warning and a count at the end.** The rest of the site is still built.
- **The names the engine keeps in the site's root are one list.** Measured against what the build writes; `series` is among them now.
- **The build's domains live beside it.** `blocks`, `output`, `feeds`, `discovery`, `cards`, and `lib/series.rb`.
- **The cheat sheet says how pictures end up side by side.**

### Fixed

- **A save interrupted by a full volume left the post at 0 bytes.** The old text gone, the new one never written.
- **A build stopped mid-write left a page, a feed or the search index at half its length.** Served that way.
- **The same delivery arriving twice made two posts.** The second one invisible to whoever wrote it.
- **Two deliveries of one receipt arriving together made two posts.** A retry that overtook the first attempt.
- **Re-importing this engine's own export wrote every post again.** 1200 posts became 2400.
- **A slug, a media name or a redirect target carrying `../` reached `mkdir`.** From a hand-edited post or somebody else's export.
- **A local deploy could write and delete files above the directory it was pointed at.** Both reported as done.
- **A feed's redirect could send the fetch to localhost or a private address.**
- **Undoing an edit could delete a post's history rather than step it aside.**
- **A replaced file came back wearing the temp file's permissions.** Under a strict umask, a page the server cannot read.
- **Two writes in one process could meet on one temp name.**
- **Repacking a video dropped its recording time.** And every sound track but the first.
- **A refused write left its first picture behind, and the retry landed on `slug-2`.** An address nobody chose.
- **A re-import stopped halfway through a change of year left the post in one year and its pictures in the other.**
- **A part numbered `08` or `09` lost its number.** Read as octal; the series fell out of order.
- **A picture restored from a backup never reached the site.** Where the build copies rather than links.
- **One address the build could not claim switched every later picture from a link to a copy.**
- **An interrupted save left a temp file in the archive.** And a refused write named the temp file, not the target.
- **Cron's files in `public/` were emptied before they were written.** A run that died left a blank `stats.json` live.
- **A page slugged `index.html` or `search-index.json` stopped every build.** Twelve root names were missing from the reserved list.
- **`check` died on a post whose `media` was an object.** Before it had reported anything.
- **`check` called an archive sound over six shapes the build dies on.** A draft token climbing out of the site among them.
- **`check --json` gave at most twenty address collisions.** The rest as a bare count, with nothing to find them by.
- **`--repair` decoded text it had never been offered.** A paragraph written meanwhile about HTML lost its point.
- **A media directory in another unicode form was called orphaned.** And `--repair` offered to trash live pictures.
- **A series whose name did not fit an address linked every part to a 404.**
- **A link post's borrowed title was printed twice in the feed.**
- **An empty heading sent the contents list one heading off.**
- **One broken post stopped the whole export.** Everything after it in alphabetical order stayed at home.
- **A page slug carrying `../` was exported above the target directory.**
- **A spacer took the next paragraph with it on the way home.** And an embed with a blank line left its markup on the page.
- **A post whose date nobody could read was dated by its file's timestamp.** For a tree just copied, the day of the import; the file name decides now, and the import says so.

## 1.7 -- 2026-09-05

The release about finishing a post rather than sending one. 1.6 got a post from a phone to the
blog and left it there as a draft, so the last step still wanted a terminal; this one publishes
from the page and lets it find out what happened. Beside that, the other half of the same idea:
changing what a post IS -- its series, tags, type and flags -- without opening what it says.

### Added

- **A post's properties, without opening the post.** `props`, key `[e]`.
- **Publishing from the phone.** The answer card gains a Publish button.
- **`publish <slug> --yes --json`.** One object, zero either way.
- **A receipt the page can ask about.** It polls instead of waiting to be told.
- **A link card in the front matter.** `link:`, `link_title:`, `link_description:`.
- **About fifty drawings for `tag_icons`.** Named, on the engine's own grid.
- **`media: remux_video: true`.** Moves a video's index to the front on the way in.
- **`check` names a video whose index is at the end.** With the command that fixes it.

### Changed

- **A stylesheet is no longer part of the engine's fingerprint.** Editing one rebuilds no pages.
- **`/write/` carries a content policy.** It is published as a file, not rendered.
- **`NOTICE`.** The fonts and brand marks the engine ships, and their licences.

### Fixed

- **A tag written `[release]` or `#foto` kept the punctuation.** So did a YAML list.
- **`tag_icons:` written as a mapping drew nothing and said nothing.**
- **The `ffmpeg` command could name its own input.** An HEVC video already in an `.mp4`.
- **The docs said a draft was deployed "only" to its hidden address.** The whole build goes.
- **A bullet wrapped onto a second line stopped being a bullet.** Silently, on every site.
- **The cheat sheet's last list rendered as a run-on paragraph.** Same reason.
- **A page called "Write" took the writer app off the site.** `write` is reserved now.
- **A link card's address could reach a live `href`.** In a post with no title of its own.
- **A second video could be written over the first.** With `media.remux_video` on.
- **`hero: false` did not survive the next edit.**
- **An `icon_svg` that was not a drawing was printed as words.** On every badge.
- **A tag icon could miss the tag it was written for.** Matched on the name, grouped on the address.
- **`check` called an archive sound while `config/site.yml` would not parse.**
- **A fresh install answered the phone with a bare exit code.** The five setup refusals.
- **The build answered an unreadable config with a backtrace.** Now it names the file.
- **A part number sent its post to the front of its series.** Instead of to that position.
- **A draft's series preview said it would be last.** Whatever number it carried.

## 1.6 -- 2026-09-03

A release about the time between deciding to publish and the site saying so. The build stops
rebuilding what nobody changed, a photograph is stored once rather than twice, and a post can arrive
as a file from a phone shortcut or a script. Beside those: share controls, tag icons, a way out of
the trash, and an engine that behaves the same down a pipe as on a terminal.

### Added

- **A page already on disk is not built again.** `rebuild --full` renders everything.
- **`add <file>` writes a post without asking anything.** It stops at the draft.
- **A post can be sent from a phone.** `scripts/receive.sh`, over the SSH the server already has.
- **And a page to write it on: `/write/`.** `write: true`; off by default.
- **The page wears the blog it writes to.** The build puts `site.js` beside it.
- **A preview, a row of marks, and video.** In the editor.
- **`publish: yes` in a file's front matter publishes it on arrival.** Anything else is a draft.
- **`add <file> --untrusted`.** A picture reference may name only a bare filename.
- **`publish <slug> --yes` and `publish --no-announce`.** The slug must be spelled out.
- **A row of share controls under a post.** Off unless `share:` names what you want.
- **A tag can carry an icon.** `tag_icons`, replacing the badge's content-type icon.
- **`empty trash` and `empty versions`.** Each asks for the count back before it removes anything.
- **`doctor` says what is in the trash.** As a note rather than a fault.
- **`check` says when a post asks for a `type:` the engine does not know.**

### Changed

- **A published picture is the archive's own file, under a second name.** A hardlink, not a copy.
- **`browse --drafts` shows scheduled drafts.** As `list --drafts` always has.
- **Esc backs out of the palette preview instead of accepting it.**
- **A relative path is read against where you are standing.** `add sub/post.md`.
- **`doctor` checks the footer's `social:` icons as it has the tag icons.** And the `share:` list.

### Fixed

- **Two posts written at the same instant left one post.**
- **A byte-order mark swallowed the whole frontmatter.** Three bytes before the opening `---`.
- **Attaching a photo through a symlinked directory in `incoming/` deleted the original.**
- **`./setup.sh | tee setup.log` echoed the access token in clear text.** Rotate it if you did.
- **A script that asks now flushes before it blocks.** All five of them.
- **The QR code for a palette preview was trimmed to unscannable thirds.** The address with it.
- **A letter outside ASCII in a tag or type crashed on a terminal.** Down a pipe it matched nothing.
- **An embed could still smuggle a script past the sanitiser.**
- **A list item under a list item could not be found from the search box.** Rebuilding reindexes.
- **One file that would not go took the whole build with it.**
- **Turning the sidebar off left yesterday's widget JSON on the site.**
- **A page was written straight through a symlink.** One left in `public.nosync/`.
- **The queue's `[m]` was offered on a terminal and accepted everywhere.**
- **Ctrl-C on the import wizard's first screens printed a stack trace.**
- **The About and footer questions lost their labels on a terminal.**
- **"Nothing changed, no post" read as though recovered text had gone with it.**

### Not fixed, on purpose

- **Backdating still costs four fifths of a full build.**
- **A nested list item is not in a post's excerpt.** Search reaches it.
- **There is no `pixelfed` in `share:`.** Pixelfed has no address a page can hand a post to.

## 1.5 -- 2026-08-30

The release about a site saying what it holds. A post that never had a title takes its name from
its own words rather than standing under its slug; an archive of thousands gets a map at
`/archive/`, and every subject the site covers gets a page at `/tag/`. Underneath, four days of
adversarial review closed 173 findings, every one pinned by a test. Nothing to migrate.

### Added

- **A post that never said what it is called gets named from its own words.**
- **A post can write its own invitation.** A line reading `//--more--//` splits it.
- **`/archive/` -- a map of the archive.** A row per year, a page per year.
- **`/tag/` -- every subject the site has.** Sorted by the folded name, or by count.
- **A listing card is cut before it is written, not hidden afterwards.** At a block boundary.
- **A code block carries a copy button.** Where the clipboard can be reached.

### Changed

- **Every listing of one kind of post says which kind, with an icon.**
- **`/tag/` shows its tags as pills in wrapped lines rather than in columns.**
- **The page is framed on all four sides, not two.** Off below 700 pixels.
- **A search result marks where one paragraph ends and the next begins.** A middle dot.
- **An announcement budgets its link the way Mastodon charges for one.** `mastodon.link_length`.
- **`doctor` says when `site.locale` and `site.lang` disagree.** A warning, not an error.
- **`check` has two more things to say.** An existing archive may report new findings.
- **A series listing pages from the part that will never change again.**
- **Posts are ordered by the moment they happened, not by the text of their timestamp.**
- **A listing page no longer carries the posts' heading anchors.**

### Fixed

- **The appearance button was dead in a browser that refuses storage.**
- **`./blog.sh edit` published the coordinates a photograph was taken at.**
- **Choosing a palette in `./style.sh` deleted 34 documented lines from `config/site.yml`.**
- **One cron tick with the archive out of reach blanked the live site's comments and counters.**
- **The scheduled-publish cron wrote back a snapshot taken before the run.**
- **A `--prune` whose deletion failed was reported as a completely clean deploy.**
- **`doctor` failed an install over a menu item that works.** A `url` with a `#fragment`.
- **`check` vouched for a link whose only backing is a redirect the build refuses.**
- **Markdown stopped losing text it has no form for.** Code spans, hard breaks, flat lists.
- **A post whose `title` is an empty string shipped a blank tab and an empty heading.**
- **The export/re-import round trip lost posts.**
- **An imported embed's scripts, style blocks and stylesheet links are stripped at render.**
- **The sitemap and the feed describe the site as built.**
- **The importers, all eleven adapters and the machinery under them.** 59 defects closed.
- **A picture was lost where `01.JPG` and `01.jpg` resolved to one file.**
- **Smaller, and there were many.** Tags, heroes, excerpts, pagination, the narrow menu.

### Not fixed, on purpose

- **Wayback's CDX paging.** Following `resumeKey` through a second request was not written.
- **The shortened link in an announcement.** Bluesky charges for a link by its length.

## 1.4 -- 2026-08-25

The widest release since 1.0, and the most thoroughly tested. Three things arrived: the commits
widget reads Gitea and Forgejo, comments work on GoToSocial with the favourite moderation Mastodon
already had, and the whole engine speaks the site's language -- deploy, build warnings,
announcements, imports alike. Under that sits a long audit over real archives. Nothing to migrate:
`git pull`, rebuild, deploy.

### Added

- **The commits widget reads Gitea and Forgejo, not just GitHub.** `widgets.commits.instance`.
- **Media are read from the year the post's file lives in.** Not by the post's date.
- **Letter case and unicode form of a filename no longer cost you the picture.**
- **The deploy manifest knows which target it describes.**
- **`./style.sh` can take a sidebar widget away again.** The block is commented out, not deleted.

### Changed

- **`check` has a ninth kind of finding: two posts at one address.** An error, so it can exit 1.
- **`doctor` fails on a config the engine cannot use.**
- **Renaming a post writes its redirect from the address the site actually served.**
- **Two pages sharing a slug stop being a silent loss.** `check` calls it an error.
- **`./blog.sh check --repair`: the checker's other half.** Nothing applied without a key press.
- **`./blog.sh check --json`: the findings themselves, all of them.**
- **Icons for Gitea, Forgejo, Codeberg and GitLab join the footer's set.**
- **A key that is written down speaks for itself.** An empty `nav:` now means no menu.
- **The sidebar column goes with its last card.** No about text and no widgets, no column.
- **The whole engine speaks the site's language.** Deploy, build warnings, imports alike.

### Fixed

- **Comments work on GoToSocial.** `comments.approval: fav` is all a token-gated server allows.
- **An install in a folder called `blog [1]` no longer publishes an empty site.**
- **A post whose slug carries `[`, `{`, `*` or `?` is no longer invisible to the commands.**
- **A bracket in an alt text no longer destroys the picture.** `![[es] W-ZERO3](...)` parses.
- **`--prune` deletes what the deploy named, and nothing else.** On `rsync` and `rclone`.
- **An interrupted sftp transfer resumes.**
- **A full disk ends a deploy with a sentence, not a traceback.**
- **Announcing a page linked to an address the site does not answer at.**
- **A post taken back down keeps its discussion off the site.**
- **An import that loses an item says which one, and exits 1.**
- **The Twitter import stopped leaving `&lt;` and `&amp;` in the text.**
- **The Facebook import says what it does not take.** Albums, uncategorised photos, videos.
- **`doctor` stopped ticking three things that were not fine.**
- **The scheduler's quiet tick is quiet.** Nothing to do, nothing on stdout.
- **`./style.sh` can point the commits widget at a forge.**
- **Turning a post into a page (or back) no longer loses its address.**
- **The build and `check` read `unlisted` with one rule.** `"no"`, `"false"` and `"0"` alike.
- **A tag too long for a filename no longer stops the build.** The cap is 200 bytes of address.
- **The feed stopped naming categories nothing stands behind.**
- **The search box folds a word the way the index folded it.** The Greek final sigma `ς` included.
- **A draft's tags no longer link to pages that do not exist.**
- **Two posts sharing a slug in two years can trade places in the queue.**
- **A media file nobody can read is now a finding, not a presence.** Zero bytes, no permission.
- **The CSP for a Bandcamp player follows the stored player address.**
- **The wizard writes the `env.sh` line the shell actually reads.**
- **The import wizard's advice about the Wayback Machine now applies to itself.**
- **A wizard import whose source died, or that wrote no items, exits non-zero.**
- **`check --repair` says whose archive it is and that it is working.**
- **The "not understood" line in `props` names the keys the row offers.**
- **A list key that held something else ended the build in a traceback.**
- **Two markdown trees no longer overwrite each other.** Import first, upgrade after.
- **A Hugo site root imports the site's content, not its machinery.**
- **The albums in a Facebook HTML export are counted.**
- **A link imported with an active-content address is defused.** http, https, mailto, tel pass.
- **A broken colour cannot take the stylesheet down.** The shipped default stands in.
- **The git backend ships the bytes the build produced.** The snapshot pins `autocrlf=false`.
- **rsync and sftp carry a filename their own tools would misread.** `#draft.html`, `- old.html`.
- **Rerouting a deploy no longer inherits the old target's manifest.** `RSYNC_SSH`, `RCLONE_ARGS`.
- **A manifest the process cannot read or write degrades, it does not crash.**
- **`doctor --online` keeps the token at home.** The probe refuses a foreign host.
- **`doctor` diagnoses a broken config in the site's language.**
- **`check` refuses everything the build refuses.**
- **A crash in the middle of a queue move cannot cost a post.**
- **"Nothing was written" is true across both files.** `site.yml` and `env.sh`.
- **An answer of "y" means yes in every language, in every dialog.** `y`, `j` and `a`.
- **Enter backs out of "add one" everywhere, and a pending copy is a listed change.**
- **Two examples in the markdown cheat sheet had stopped playing.** SoundCloud and PeerTube.

## 1.3.2 -- 2026-08-21

A GoToSocial release. GTS speaks Mastodon's API but answers with its own accents -- ULID account
ids, and content negotiation on Accept -- and two places in the engine assumed the Mastodon dialect
was the only one. Both fixes came from the first blog.sh site paired with one, arch-linux.cz, which
also asked for the one small thing here for skins. Nothing to migrate -- `git pull`, rebuild, deploy.

### Added

- **A listing page now says whether it is the first one.** `page-first` and `page-cont` on `<body>`.

### Fixed

- **The feed widget, the Pixelfed widget and the feed importer asked for `application/json` first.**
- **`doctor` and `./style.sh` refused every GoToSocial account id.** Pleroma flakes too.

## 1.3.1 -- 2026-08-20

A bug-fix release about three things: the publishing queue -- what the cron may announce, in what
order, and who may write it while somebody else is reading; the first hour of an install, where a
site with no deploy target is told where it is and in which language; and emptiness, where a section
emptied on purpose stops crashing the build. Nothing to migrate -- `git pull`, rebuild, deploy.

### Fixed

- **The scheduled-publish cron announced backdated posts as if they were news.**
- **A post that had already been announced could be announced a second time.**
- **Posts that came due in the same tick were published in alphabetical order.** Oldest first now.
- **The guard against a second announcement only covered the cron.** `toot` and `bluesky` too.
- **The cron read `unlisted` more narrowly than the site does.**
- **Two queue writes still ran outside the lock.** The [s] and [n] dialogs.
- **`check` could not see a link written relative to the post.** `./?item=another-post`.
- **The example config had chosen Mastodon for you.** Both networks ship commented out.
- **A `links:` key with no list under it ended the build in a stack trace.**
- **`doctor` failed an install over states the templates support on purpose.**
- **An emptied `about` drew an empty card on every page.**
- **Four places promised that an empty menu leaves no bar.** `nav: []` keeps the search field.
- **A fresh install was told its site is at `example.com`.**
- **The deploy said "the site goes nowhere" in English on a site that is not English.**
- **The editor template's body was English on every site.**
- **The Instagram import's "no posts found" hint stopped one level too high.**
- **The scheduling question worked against the person answering it.**
- **`publishing.slots` existed only for whoever found it in the documentation.**
- **A heading could not be turned off.** An empty heading now renders none at all.
- **A Surfer nobody can reach arrived as a backtrace too.**
- **A config the filesystem refused to write arrived as a backtrace.** `./style.sh`, `./setup.sh`.
- **Reordering the queue wrote without the lock the cron holds.**

## 1.3 -- 2026-08-19

The release about dressing a site without editing the engine: your own stylesheet, menu,
sidebar and lead image are settings now, and `./style.sh` writes every one of them. Around
that grew a release about trusting the archive -- `check` says what is broken, `export`
walks it back out as markdown, `stats` counts it, and every edit is undoable ten versions
deep.

### New

- **`./blog.sh check`.** Missing media, dead links, an address two posts claim.
- **`check` also sees the file a post no longer names.** A warning, per post and per file.
- **`./blog.sh export`.** The archive as markdown in Jekyll's layout, media included.
- **Media is fetched once, and a file's identity is its address.** `REFETCH_MEDIA=1` asks again.
- **Carrying a post through the publishing queue.** `[m]` picks it up, the arrows carry it.
- **Unlisted posts.** `unlisted: true` keeps the address and leaves every listing.
- **`./blog.sh stats`.** The archive counted from the posts on disk; also `--json`.
- **Editing a post is undoable.** `[v]` in `props` puts a version back: ten per post.
- **Pages.** `page: true` gives a post a permanent address at the root.
- **A 404 page**, built by the site rather than left to the host.
- **Series.** `series:` groups posts, `series_part:` orders them.
- **Reading time and a table of contents.** From four headings up, or with `toc:`.
- **`fediverse:creator`.** The author's account on a shared link's preview card.
- **A feed per tag, for the tags the menu names.** With autodiscovery on the tag's page.
- **`seo.block_ai_crawlers` and `seo.robots_extra`.** Off by default.
- **`site.extra_css`.** Stylesheets loaded after the engine's own; this site only.
- **Your own menu (`nav:`).** Entries the site names; an empty list turns the menu off.
- **`layout.sidebar` and `layout.hero`.** The sidebar off, the first image above the title.
- **`./style.sh` can set everything about how the site looks.**
- **Only the comments you star, if you want it that way.** `comments.approval: fav`.
- **A reply's pictures appear with it.** Images only, never from a reply marked sensitive.

### Changed

- **A listing's heading marks what it is instead of saying it twice.**
- **`config/site.yml.example` opens with an index** of every section and key.
- **The publishing queue comes back to the post you just moved** -- by name, not by row.
- **Restoring an earlier version is a list you walk, not a number you type.**
- **Action rows fold instead of wrapping mid-word** on a narrow terminal.
- **Tab completes paths in the import wizard**, directories with spaces included.
- **The wizard holds still.** Every screen repaints over itself.
- **"yes" is a keypress, not any word that starts with one.** Piped answers are matched whole.
- **Moderation housekeeping.** `comments.json` is written only while moderation is on.
- **A listing card says how long its post takes to read.** Too short to time says "under a minute".

### Fixed

- **An announcement that does not happen says why.** A missing network section is named as one.
- **`config/site.yml.example` says how to read itself.** One `#` before a key means uncomment me.
- **`doctor` stops agreeing with that mistake.** A credential with no section is a warning.
- **A YAML error admits the line may not be the mistake.** Both messages name the two shapes.
- **The appearance toggle can find its way back to the system.** It cycles system / light / dark.
- **A markdown tree's pages arrive, and arrive as pages.** Root-level markdown is read now.
- **A re-imported post no longer collects a platform tag it has already got.**
- **`hero:` survived a save.** An edit no longer rebuilds the post without the key.
- **Keyboard focus can be seen again.** One `:focus-visible` ring for the whole site.
- **The site holds still for a reader who asked it to.** `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured.
- **The banner's two lines stop printing over each other on a phone.**
- **The menu on a phone closes with Escape and with a tap on the page.**
- **Search answers with its best results, not its most recent ones.** Ties keep their date order.
- **A search no longer draws a card for every post it found.** The count still says how many.
- **On a phone the search field is in the bar, not folded into the menu.**
- **The lightbox can be opened, walked and closed without a mouse.**
- **Small things, one sweep.** A passive scroll listener, avatar dimensions, bigger tap targets.
- **A search has an address again.** `?q=` follows the query as it is typed.
- **Every page has an h1.** The front page carries the site's title, clipped.
- **`check` no longer calls a working address dead.** A healthy archive stops failing on cron.
- **Unlisted is unlisted the whole way round.** The sitemap and the search index too.
- **`export` sees a directory that holds only dotfiles.** A fresh clone is not empty.
- **What a wizard prints is no longer erased by the screen it paints.**
- **A series listing said "SérieNový Sean.cz".** It gets an icon like the other listings.
- **The clock in the meta row was a fifth larger than the row it stood in.**
- **A Hugo picture written as `{{< figure >}}` arrived as nothing at all.**
- **An article that showed Markdown in a code block had its example eaten.**
- **Four ways an import stayed quiet about what it did.** Each is kept or said out loud now.
- **What the body could not keep is counted for everyone.** Whichever adapter was driving.
- **A percent-escaped filename was slugified character by character**, minting `ef-bf-bc...`.
- **A WordPress import's closing numbers described a different import.**
- **A video uploaded to Ghost was lost, and three lines of its player published in its place.**
- **A second import took away what the first one brought.** `redirect_from` addresses are merged.
- **Ten re-imports that changed nothing filled all ten version slots.** A duplicate is not written.
- **An AVIF image came in with no dimensions.** The bytes decide the type now.
- **`[](url)` was printed to the reader as raw markdown**, and heading ids came from it.
- **An attachment did not survive `export` and back.** It goes out as HTML, `download` and all.
- **"Images come from the tree itself -- no network" was only ever true of Jekyll.**
- **`props` stopped condemning a redirect a draft is holding.** The takeover waits for that draft.
- **`./blog.sh rebuild` under a held lock exits non-zero**, with the lock's own code.
- **Five corrections to the tree import.**
- **A nested `<a>` closes the open one**, as a browser reads what some Ghost exports carry.
- **A warning no longer outruns the output it belongs under.** The cron entry points sync stdout.

### Upgrading

- **Nothing to migrate.** The top bar is sticky and the menu repeated under the content is gone.
- **The next deploy is a full one rather than incremental.** The shared layout changed.
- **The front page carries the site's title as a clipped heading.** Nothing is drawn.
- **A stylesheet of your own that positioned `.banner-title` or `.banner-claim` wants a look.**
- **Post versions live in `content.nosync/versions/`.** A backup of `content.nosync/` covers them.
- **A rebuild that stepped aside for a held lock now exits 3, not 0.** Cron paths are untouched.
- **A markdown-tree re-import no longer copies an image's alt text into a visible caption.**

## 1.2.1 -- 2026-08-12

A bug-fix release on top of 1.2, with two things added to it: the site's own words are
Markdown now, and a photo no longer publishes the place it was taken. The rest is repair --
parsing, imported tables, the location strip itself, and what the wizard says when a run is
already going. Nothing to migrate: `git pull`, rebuild, deploy.

### New

- **The site's own words are Markdown.** Raw HTML still passes through.
- **A photo no longer publishes the place it was taken.** `media.strip_location: false` keeps it.
- **`./blog.sh doctor --strip-location`.** Takes the location out of photos saved earlier.
- **A table can have no header row.** Open it with the separator line, `| --- | --- |`.

### Changed

- **A new default banner, at 1880x600.** Only new installations see it.
- **`config/site.yml.example` uses a literal block scalar (`|-`).** Existing configs are untouched.

### Fixes

- **A continuation line under a nested list item crashed everything that read it.**
- **Every imported table handed its first row of data to a `<th>`.** Wix and the HTML path.
- **A Tumblr ask read as if the blog's owner had asked themselves.** Re-import to pick this up.
- **`doctor --strip-location` cleaned the archive and left the site alone.**
- **A GPS entry's data offset was trusted absolutely.**
- **`./style.sh` reported a held lock as a failed upload.**
- **The palette preview promised more than it could keep.** The next build removes it.
- **"Another run is still going" did not say to try again.**
- **Smaller ones.** Nine: four in the parser, three in the importers, two in the location strip.

### Upgrading

- **Nothing has to change.** Photos saved from now on lose their coordinates.
- **`about.html` and `footer.note_html` still written as `>-` need changing to `|-`.**

## 1.2 -- 2026-08-11

The import release. Eight sources became twenty-two -- every blog platform worth naming, the whole
social roster, podcasts, a plain markdown tree, and the Wayback Machine for blogs whose platform is
gone. Two wizards come with it, `./setup.sh` for the settings an install cannot run without and
`./style.sh` for how the site looks, plus a queue screen, an archive browser, redirects and
`./blog.sh doctor`.

### New

- **Eight import sources became twenty-two.**
- **`./setup.sh` -- setting a site up is now a conversation.** Every answer is checked.
- **`./style.sh` -- the appearance half, and seven palettes to pick from.**
- **`./blog.sh doctor` -- everything wrong with a configuration, at once.** `--online` goes further.
- **The queue got its own screen.** `./blog.sh queue`.
- **The archive is something you walk through, not a list that scrolls past.** `./blog.sh browse`.
- **Six more platforms play in a post, from their address alone.**
- **A migrated blog can keep its old addresses.** `redirect_from`, served by the build.
- **More of the look comes from the config: the header's type, and two more social icons.**
- **An interrupted post is offered back instead of just kept.**
- **A phone video says what it is.** HEVC or a `.mov` container, warned once.
- **Post pages now carry the metadata crawlers and phone browsers look for.**
- **Builds and deploys take a lock.** Two runs can no longer rewrite `public.nosync` at once.

### Changed

- **Configuration the engine writes keeps its comments.** A syntax error names line and column.
- **Every screen says which blog you are in, and the layout gives the width to the text.**

### Fixes

- **An export could hand over its posts and leave you without them.**
- **A post that did arrive came without its pictures and its links.**
- **A post nobody was meant to read went onto the open web.**
- **One unescaped `&` in an export no longer costs the whole archive.**
- **A feed's own address was misread, so every re-import wrote the archive again.**
- **Media filenames depend only on the order a post references them.** See *Upgrading*.
- **A failed download says why, retries when that helps, and never leaves half a file behind.**
- **A busy or throttling Archive no longer reads as a blog that was never archived.**
- **A rescue says up front what it can and cannot recover.**
- **The import preview and the summary now tell the truth about what arrived.**
- **An imported Wix table came back as a paragraph of pipes on the first save.**
- **A paid post imported looking exactly like a free one.**
- **A pair of imported redirects could stop the site building at all.**
- **A `<lj user>` mention pointed at somebody else's journal.**
- **A large export says what it will cost before it takes it.** Past 20 MB.
- **Editing a post can no longer silently corrupt it.**
- **The editor holds on to what you typed.**
- **Deleting one post threw away another's only backup, and the trash would not open.**
- **A post that moves across a New Year keeps its old link, and its own pictures.**
- **Publishing again after a re-import redirects the old address.**
- **A file you add to a post is measured and identified by what it is.**
- **Scheduling a post works again -- every route into it was dead.**
- **A dialog left open can no longer overwrite a post the cron published.**
- **The queue acts on the post you picked, and a reorder is all or nothing.**
- **An announcement could be left hanging in public, and nothing said so.**
- **Enter means "leave it alone", the way the wizards document it.**
- **Nothing is touched before you confirm, and one bad line no longer costs the session.**
- **The wizards work on Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 again.**
- **The archive browser draws and reads the terminal properly now.**
- **Page Up (and Home, End, Insert, Delete) left a stray key behind in every menu.**
- **An imported archive is text somebody else wrote, and several places left it unescaped.**
- **Each page's Content-Security-Policy is computed from what that page carries.**
- **The menu no longer runs under the search box.**
- **Nothing empty is drawn any more.**
- **The crons could not be trusted to say what happened.**
- **The deploy guards hold, and a busy lock reads as a collision.**
- **The commands that exist for a broken install now survive one.**
- **`doctor` and the engine now agree on what counts as configured.**
- **`./blog.sh preview` no longer serves your archive to the local network.**
- **A consistency pass over everything the interface says, in all three languages.**

### Upgrading

- **Nothing to migrate.** `git pull`, rebuild, deploy -- but expect a long first deploy.
- **Media numbering, for posts whose downloads failed under 1.1.** Delete their media directories.
- **Menu positions moved, so stop piping numbers at them.** `queue` and `list` are stable.
- **Builds and deploys take a lock now.** A run that finds it held does not queue.
- **Three more working files.** `.last-edit.meta`, `.blog-sh.lock`, `.last-scheduled-run`.
- **Going back to 1.1 builds, but do not write under it.**

## 1.1 -- 2026-08-05

Six things a site can now do that it couldn't, and one class of defect taken out of the deploy: the
guards measure a build against the last build they accepted rather than against the target, so
nothing can switch them off. Nothing to migrate -- `git pull`, rebuild, deploy -- but three changes
are worth reading before you upgrade, at the bottom.

### New

- **A post can be pinned to the front page.** `pinned: true`, first listing page only.
- **Publishing slots turn `[s]` into a queue.** `publishing.slots`; a typed date overrides.
- **Posts can carry files.** A line that is nothing but `[label](handbook.pdf)`.
- **One dialog for a post's properties and actions.** `props <slug>`, seven actions under `[c]`.
- **A slug can be renamed without breaking a link.** `[r]` keeps a redirect at every old address.
- **HEIC photos are refused, or converted on request.** `media.convert_heic: true`.

### Deploy safety

- **The guards could be switched off permanently, silently.**
- **They also fired when they shouldn't.** The percentages carry absolute floors now.
- **Total bytes are guarded too.** A drop stops the deploy, an increase only says so.
- **An empty build is refused.**
- **A failing deploy explains itself.** The previous run's outcome opens the next one.

### Fixes

- **A re-import minted a duplicate post.** When the text behind the slug changed at the source.
- **An import whose source died mid-paging crashed with a backtrace.**
- **Imported drafts landed at a guessable `/draft//<slug>/` address.** Without the token.
- **The interactive picker refused a slug that starts with a digit.**
- **The pin, the slots and the document type each shipped with a defect.**
- **The wizard banner showed the site's description, and a punycode guess for the domain.**
- **The properties dialog could revert a post the cron had just published.**

### Upgrading

- **The wizard menu was renumbered.** A scripted `printf "4\n" | ./blog.sh` picks another entry.
- **A single file over 100 MB is now refused.** `--force` does not lift it.
- **A new state file, `.deploy_baseline.json`.** Gitignored; losing it costs one deploy.

## 1.0.1 -- 2026-08-02

The first release after 1.0, and all of it repair. Every flow was walked end to end -- authoring,
publishing, both cron jobs, the build, the deploy, the importers -- asking of each step what
happens if it fails there. What came back was mostly failures partway through: a post half moved, a
batch half published, a deploy half uploaded. Nothing to migrate.

### Data that could be lost

- **`edit` with a date in another year could destroy the post.** Neither year, nor `trash/`.
- **A failed write truncated the post it was rewriting.** Every post write, and the deploy manifest.
- **A new photo could overwrite an existing one.** An image kept from a previous save.
- **A new post could land on a leftover media directory and lose its own upload.**
- **A source file missing for a moment could be deleted from the live site.**

### Flows that could not finish

- **The scheduled-publish cron could wedge permanently.** A post with photos into an empty year.
- **One imported post could stop the site from building at all.** With an error naming no post.
- **The sidebar refresh never uploaded anything.** On a site without all five widgets.
- **An interrupted deploy locked out every later one.** Including the ones the CLI runs itself.
- **A closed stdin spun at full CPU.** The wait-for-photos loop.
- **One unreadable post file took down the build, `list`, every picker and the cron at once.**

### Correctness

- **An edit saved across the cron tick that published the post reverted it to a scheduled draft.**
- **An ambiguous slug was resolved again at every internal step.** "Which year?", more than once.
- **GIF and WebP images were silently dropped from every page.** Caption and all.
- **An import preview promised more posts and media than the real run wrote.**
- **Feed fetches had no total deadline.** 30 seconds now, redirects included.
- **An emoji-only tag rendered as a link to `/tag//`.**
- **`--force` deploy forgot files pending deletion on the target.** They could never be pruned.

### Added

- **`./blog.sh version`, also `--version`.** In the wizard banner and the engine's User-Agent.
- **The backup checklist names `assets/images/header.png` and `favicon.png`.**

### Upgrading

`git pull`, then rebuild and deploy. On an existing site the only visible change is that images the
engine cannot measure now appear rather than vanishing.

## 1.0 -- 2026-07-31

The first stable release: a file-based blog engine where posts are JSON files, the site is a
static build, authoring happens in a terminal and comments live on the Fediverse. No database,
no admin server, Ruby stdlib and bash -- no gems, no npm (one asterisk: the optional
Pixelfed/RSS widgets need `rexml`, a default gem some distributions package separately).

- **Content model.** One post is one JSON file of typed blocks.
- **Authoring.** An interactive CLI wizard, with hidden preview addresses for drafts.
- **Markdown.** A deliberate subset, with a cheat sheet the parser generates itself.
- **Build.** Static HTML via ERB, memoized so that only what changed is written.
- **Comments and announcements.** Announced on Mastodon or Bluesky; the replies are the comments.
- **Deploy.** Six backends behind one manifest-driven diff.
- **Import.** Eight sources, verified against real archives.
- **i18n.** English, Czech and German. A language is one YAML file.
- **Appearance.** A complete theme from seven colour keys per mode.
- **Security by subtraction.** CSP meta, self-hosted assets, no third-party requests.
