# build/blocks.rb -- one content block into HTML.
#
# The first domain lifted out of build_blog.rb, and the one with the
# least holding it there: seventeen functions that take a block and give
# back markup, reaching for nothing the build knows except the escaper
# and the locale. Everything about WHICH blocks get rendered, in what
# order and onto which page, stays where it was.
#
# The three constants moved with them because nothing else has ever
# asked for them, and they are the vocabulary of exactly this job: what
# an autolink looks like, what punctuation falls off the end of one, and
# the three ways a table cell may be aligned.
#
# Constants the BUILD owns -- SITE_BASE_URL, MEDIA_PREFIX and the rest --
# still resolve from in here: a module body`s lexical scope ends at
# Object, which is where a script`s top-level constants live. Same for
# the top-level helpers these call, h() and t(): they are private methods
# of Object, and a module is an Object. So this is a move, not a rewrite,
# which is the only kind of change worth making to code that has no
# test of its own beyond the site it produces.
