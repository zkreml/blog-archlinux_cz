# build/feeds.rb -- the two documents written for machines.
#
# The RSS feed and the sitemap have almost nothing in common with the
# rest of the build: no template, no layout, no chrome, no cache key of
# their own. They take a list of posts and produce one file each, and
# they are the only place in the engine that has to think about XML
# escaping rather than HTML escaping -- which is exactly why they are
# worth keeping together and away from everything that escapes the other
# way.
#
# A move, not a rewrite: the build`s own constants and helpers still
# resolve from in here, because a module body`s lexical scope ends at
# Object and top-level defs are private methods of Object. The three
# heredocs are all <<~, so the indentation this file adds is stripped
# back out and the bytes on disk are the bytes that were there before.
