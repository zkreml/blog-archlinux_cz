# setup.sh is self-evidently where you start. blog.sh, by contrast,

# thing that refuses to run.

# Nothing is written until the end: the wizard collects every answer,
# shows both files' diffs, and asks once. Ctrl-C leaves the install
# exactly as it was. Re-running it is safe and is how you change any of
# these later -- every question arrives with the current value, and Enter

Asks for the settings a site needs to work, checks the answers as it
goes, and writes them into config/site.yml and env.sh -- leaving every
comment in both files exactly where it was, so they stay readable and
hand-editable afterwards.

What it asks about:

  language          which of locales/*.yml the site (and this wizard) speaks
  identity          title, short name, description, author
  timezone          checked against this machine's zone database -- a typo
                    here would silently date every post wrong
  address           the canonical URL, in both files, since env.sh's copy
                    overrides config/site.yml's and shipping them out of
                    step is a trap
  comments network  Mastodon or Bluesky (never both -- the build refuses
                    that), with the access token verified against the
                    instance on the spot; the numeric account id for the
                    toots sidebar widget is read back out of that same
                    check, so nobody has to go and find it
  deploy target     one of the six backends, each asking only for its own
                    values, or "not yet" for a site that has nowhere to go

Every question can be skipped with Enter, which keeps the current value.
Nothing is written until you have seen the diff and confirmed it; the
result is verified by reading it back, and restored from a backup if it
does not read back the way it was asked for.
